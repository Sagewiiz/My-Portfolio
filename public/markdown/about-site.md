# About This Site

This is my macOS‑style portfolio, built from scratch using:

- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Zustand for state management
- UnoCSS for utility‑first styling

Deployed easily to Vercel Pages. The UI includes a desktop with windows (Dock, Top Bar, Spotlight, Launchpad) and several built‑in apps (Safari, Terminal, Typora, Bear, FaceTime, VSCode) showcasing my work.
